Add "QuadMatch Royale" - a complete 4-player strategic card matching game as a React component.

GAME RULES & MECHANICS:

SETUP:
- User enters 4 unique names at start
- Create deck of 16 cards: each name appears exactly 4 times
- Shuffle deck and deal 4 random cards to each of 4 players
- Players positioned as: South (human), West (AI), North (AI), East (AI)

ROUND FLOW:
1. Each player selects one card from their hand to pass
2. Human player manually selects, AI players auto-select based on strategy
3. All selected cards rotate clockwise simultaneously:
   - South → West
   - West → North
   - North → East
   - East → South
4. Check all hands for win condition (4 identical cards)
5. If winner found, end game and calculate rankings
6. If no winner, start next round

AI STRATEGY (CRITICAL - IMPLEMENT THIS LOGIC):
For each AI player selecting which card to pass, prioritize in this order:
1. IF hand has 3-of-a-kind: NEVER pass that card type (pass the singleton)
2. IF hand has 2-of-a-kind: Try to keep the pair, pass from the other two cards
3. IF no matches: Pass the card type that appears least frequently in hand
4. Tie-breaker: Pass the card received most recently (least time in hand)

WIN DETECTION:
- After each card rotation, check if any player has 4 identical cards
- First player to achieve this wins immediately

RANKING SYSTEM (when game ends):
1st place: The winner (4-of-a-kind)
2nd-4th place ranked by:
   - 3-of-a-kind > 2-of-a-kind > 1-of-a-kind > no matches
   - If tied on match level, earlier formation ranks higher
   - Track round number when each match level was first achieved

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Single React functional component using useState, useEffect, useCallback
- Tailwind CSS only for styling
- No external dependencies beyond React
- Self-contained, easy to integrate
- Export as default component named "QuadMatchRoyale"

COMPONENT STATE TO MANAGE:
- gamePhase: 'setup' | 'playing' | 'gameOver'
- playerNames: array of 4 name strings entered by user
- hands: object with keys 'south', 'west', 'north', 'east', each holding array of 4 cards
- selectedCard: currently selected card by human player
- currentRound: number
- winner: player position who won
- rankings: final placement of all players
- matchHistory: tracking when each player formed matches (for ranking tie-breaks)

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. SETUP PHASE:
   - 4 input fields for names with validation
   - Start button disabled until all 4 names entered
   - No duplicate names allowed
   - Clear error messages

2. GAME INITIALIZATION:
   - Create deck from 4 names (4 copies each)
   - Shuffle using Fisher-Yates algorithm
   - Deal 4 cards to each player randomly
   - Set South as human player

3. HUMAN TURN:
   - Display 4 cards in hand clearly
   - Click to select one card to pass
   - Visual highlight on selection
   - "Pass Card" button becomes active after selection
   - Show which card will go to West player

4. AI TURN (simultaneous):
   - Implement AI strategy logic exactly as specified above
   - Process instantly (no artificial delay needed)
   - Don't reveal AI selections until rotation phase

5. CARD ROTATION PHASE:
   - Animate cards moving clockwise
   - Update all hands simultaneously
   - 500ms animation duration
   - Show card flow visually

6. WIN CHECK:
   - After each rotation, check all 4 hands
   - If any player has 4 identical cards, trigger win
   - Calculate rankings for all players
   - Display results screen

7. RESULTS SCREEN:
   - Show winner with celebration
   - Display final rankings with reasoning:
     * Show each player's final hand
     * Show match type (4-of-a-kind, 3-of-a-kind, etc.)
   - Game statistics (rounds played)
   - "Play Again" button (keeps same names)
   - "New Game" button (enter new names)

UI LAYOUT:
- Compass layout: South (bottom), West (left), North (top), East (right)
- South player: cards face-up, large and interactive
- AI players: cards face-down, smaller, show card backs
- Central area: round counter, game status, action prompts
- Smooth transitions between all game states

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Each name type gets unique color/style
- Cards are large, readable, with clear names
- Selected card has distinct highlight
- Card movement animations are smooth
- Win celebration is prominent
- Modern, clean card game aesthetic
- Mobile responsive (stack vertically if needed)

GAME FLOW TIMING:
- Human selection: wait for player input
- AI selection: instant (calculated immediately)
- Card rotation: 500ms animation
- Win check: immediate after rotation
- Round increment: automatic if no winner
- Next round starts immediately

EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:
- Prevent clicking during card rotation animation
- Ensure shuffle creates valid solvable game
- Handle multiple players achieving same match level
- Track formation timing for tie-breaking
- Validate all 4 names are unique and non-empty
- Disable card selection during AI turns

CODE QUALITY:
- Clear function names explaining game logic
- Comments on AI strategy implementation
- Separated concerns (game logic vs UI)
- Easy to modify card/player count
- Reusable helper functions
- Well-organized state management

PERFORMANCE:
- Efficient re-renders (use React.memo if needed)
- Smooth 60fps animations
- No lag during AI calculations
- Quick game reset

Provide complete, production-ready code that I can immediately integrate into my React web app. Make it addictive, fast-paced, and strategically interesting.
